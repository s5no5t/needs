needs
=====

Needs manages requirements. It stores requirement relationships and visualizes 
then in graphs.

It is written in rails and uses a number of gems:

* client side data is held in view models using `knockoutjs`
* requirement relationships are shown in graphs using `arbor`
* for a column layout, `compass` with `susy` are used
* an api is provided using `rabl`
